##Import data and library
```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(nycflights13)
library(ggplot2)
library(magrittr)
data(flights)
```


##Question 1

How many flights were carried out at the first day of January 2013?

```{r cars}
flights %>% 
  filter(day == 1, month == 1, year == 1)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
